    "This notebook is for the purpose of manually analysing the summaries in the dataset. The goal is to identify features that can be used to evaluate the quality of the summaries. This will be used to inform the design of the evaluation metric.\n",

    "* collapse all whitespace to single space\n",
    "* count capitalised words as features\n",
    "* assess quotation quality by comparing text in quotation marks to text in the prompts\n",
    "* measure adjective repetition\n",
    "* compare reference styles\n",
    "* measure sentence complexity and variation\n",
    "* measure sentence length summary stats (avg/max)\n",
    "* measure word complexity / complex word count\n",
    "* measure list type: asyndeton vs syndeton\n",
    "* many words joined together -- separate in pre-processing\n",
    "* Use proportion of text quoted a feature\n",
    "* Feature of sentence starting words (e.g. \"And\" = bad)\n",
    "* Feature of summary starting words (e.g. \"It\" = bad)\n",
    "* Typo count\n",
    "* Use typo-corrected versions for some features, and original for others\n",
    "* Measure use of author's name\n",
    "* Count number of references\n",
    "* Count number of citations\n",
    "* Compare summary features with other summaries of that prompt\n",
    "* For most features, use the non-quote part of the summary\n"
