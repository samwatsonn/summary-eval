For example, if meat is discovered to be sour after being taken from the pickle, it is rubbed with soda to take the smell away. Chemistry was also practiced to choose the color, flavor, and odor of the ruined meat (paragraph 2). This meant that to successfully cover up the unsanitary meat sold to the public, chemistry was practiced to make it look healthy. In addition, chemical combinations, such as borax and glycerin, were added to spoiled meat and dumped back into the hopper to be sold to the public (paragraph 3). They were able to not only preserve the moldy meat with borax, but also mixed it in with fresh meats to cover up the taste or smell of spoiled meat.

237657cb7563,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy is that it should incite feelings of pity and fear within us. Aristotle believes that a good tragedy doesn't just show for the spectacle, but truly makes us feel for the characters, and incites those feelings of pity and fear.  As Aristotle states, ""It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear."" Aristotle also believes that another element of the ideal tragedy does not feature a turn from bad to good, but instead should feature the reverse and should go from good to bad. He believes that this turn should be brought about by a crucial mistake made by a character. The third element of an ideal tragedy is one with a single issue as its plot. Aristotle compares those with a ""double threat of plot"", like the Odyssey, as second rank. He believes that it is only considered the best because of the weakness of the audience. A true poet doesn't write just based on the wishes of the audience and because of that misses the true tragic pleasure of an ideal tragedy.","Sure, here is the rewritten passage with a similar number of words and writing ability level:  According to Aristotle, a tragedy should evoke feelings of pity and fear in the audience.

Aristotle emphasizes that a tragedy should not revert from good to bad, but rather should feature the reverse where a character suffers a downfall caused by a critical mistake. Additionally, Aristotle believes that a tragedy should feature only a single central conflict in its plot.
