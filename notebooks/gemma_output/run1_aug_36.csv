7d881c44e9e7,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, the first element of an ideal tragedy is that it should have a complex storyline that evokes emotion in the audience.

It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man...""  Here he states that the tragedy should show complex characters with a complex storyline so the audience can feel different emotions that should be felt in a tragedy, such as pity and fear. The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa. For example, in paragraph 2, Aristotle states, ""...here remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous..."" Throughout the paragraph Aristotle shows that a character should fall in between good and evil, which in turn can evoke more emotion in the audience rather than merely being shocked. The third element of a tragedy is that the complex storyline and plot should have the character's fortune go from good to bad, because of a greater mistake created. Aristotle continues to mention this throughout paragraph 3 as the ending should always be in misfortune or unhappiness. This is truly defined as a tragedy because of  how these types of common endings surprise the audience as it might be something unexpected.","Sure, here is the reworded passage:  According to Aristotle, the first essential element of an ideal tragedy is the intricate storyline that evokes strong emotions in the audience. Paragraph 2 underscores this concept, stating that tragedy should be characterized by dynamic action sequences that elicit feelings of both fear and pity. It emphasizes that the focus should remain on the progression of misfortune from a protagonist who starts on a positive path to a negative end.  Another essential feature of tragedy is the presence of a flawed character who experiences a downfall due to a significant mistake. Aristotle's paragraph 2 presents this concept with the character in between virtue and vice, showcasing a life marked by errors and setbacks. This underscores that the tragic arc should reflect a character's gradual transition between positive and negative extremes.  Finally, the intricate storyline and plot in a tragedy are understood to have an escalating trajectory, where the protagonist's fortune progressively declines due to the consequences of their actions. This rising-and-falling pattern ensures that the audience is surprised and caught off guard when the dramatic climax occurs in a tragedy, which ultimately transcends simple shock value.",3.01364175566808,1.71031273290816
