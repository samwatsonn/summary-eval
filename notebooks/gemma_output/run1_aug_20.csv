Specifically, Sinclar reveals the immoral actions that transpired in an attempt to cover up spoiled meat.  Sinclar indicates that the factories covered up spoiled meat through masking odors, reusing rejected meat, and combining normal meat and rat meat simply out of pure laziness. For example, Sinclar states that the meat ""would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" That quote in itself explains one of the many attempts in which the factories hid their corrupt techniques.

One notable instance cited by Sinclar is the disposal of spoiled meat by stuffing it into hoppers and later making it part of home food.
