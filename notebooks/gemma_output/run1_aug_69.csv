f53c3a08ba01,ebad26,"In the meatpacking industry, the workers would use certain methods, such as taking the bones out of rotten ham or pickling the ham to reduce the odor.  Sinclair states that ""some ingenious person had hit upon a new device"" where they would ""extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay"" in order to get rid of grades for the meats (Sinclair 2). Even though a bad part of the meat was being extracted, the way it was done was still unsanitary and it was used as a scheme by the meatpacking industry to appeal to the greater population. The meatpacking industry found another way to increase productivity by ""fill[ing] a ham with pickle in a few seconds"" through the process of using a ""needle into the meat and working with his foot"" in order to make the meat last longer, even at the cost of ruining its sanitation (Sinclair 2). The fact that the workers would use their feet in the process indicated how the meatpacking industry was corrupt when it came to providing sanitary ham's to the population and that it would find any way possible to increase productivity and cover-up spoiled meat.

Despite this approach, the method used in practice was unsanitary and was employed as a deceptive strategy by the industry. This deceptive tactic aimed to deceive the public and uphold the unsanitary practices inherent in industrial production.  Their desperation to increase productivity resulted in an additional technique that involved filling a ham with pickle and manipulating its preservation using a needle and foot. This demonstrated the willingness of the meatpacking industry to prioritize profit over hygiene, ultimately leading to the mistreatment of food products and the potential contamination of the public.",1.61714549933614,2.05615818107854

This technique allowed the factory to mask the smell of spoiled meat.  Paragraph 4: The floor was littered with discarded meat, which posed a potential health hazard.
