This system maintained order and provided a framework for society. Without order, there would be chaos and a breakdown of social services.

The lowest class, comprised of slaves, peasants, and farmers, faced significant barriers in climbing up the social ladder. Those who worked very hard or sent their children to learn trades could gradually climb to the middle class. The middle class was dominated by soldiers, who played a crucial role in maintaining order and ensuring the safety of the lower classes. Noblemen and priests resided above the middle class, and the pharaohs, considered the supreme leaders, held an awe-inspiring position. Their influence stemmed from their unique authority and the vast resources at their disposal, thus making them nearly gods. The pharaohs were revered and entrusted with overseeing their country's affairs in grand pyramids and tombs. Their",1.92659034072495,0.668115311287519
be99c23d6b55,3b9047,"The ancient Egyptian government was run by a Pharoah. The Pharoah was considered a God or God-like and was very highly praised. They had control over all their subjects and citizens. They usually were built pyramids for their tombs. Under the Pharoah was a minister or vizier. The vizier's job was to collect taxes and to make sure everyone paid them.  Scribes worked with the vizier because they held government records. Scribes were important because they could read and write.  Then there were nobles and priests. Priests would feed and please the gods to make them happy.  Nobles would hold government posts and they profited from the gifts. There were also soldiers who would fight in wars. And workers such as craftsmen and women and physicians. They were in the middle class.  Then there were the merchants who sold goods to the citizens who bought them. At the bottom, there were farmers and slaves. The slaves were captured prisoners and they would be forced to work on buildings. Farmers did a lot for the Egyptians. They would take care of animals, tended the fields that provided food, kept canals, and worked in quarries. They did all this work and had to pay more than 50 % of their harvest in taxes. The social classes were involved because the people who worked for the Pharoah were at the top of the pyramid. The middle was merchants, craftsmen and woman, jewelers, and more. At the bottom was the farmers and slaves. ","Sure, here's is reworded version:  The ancient Egyptian government was led by a Pharaoh. The Pharaoh was considered a god by the people and was highly revered for his authority and benevolence. They exerted control over all citizens through tax collection and the appointment of ministers and officials. Scribes were crucial in this system, managing government records and serving as scribes. They were highly valued for their ability to read and write.  Nobles occupied higher positions in the government, benefiting from the resources and gifts bestowed upon them. Soldiers were involved in military service, drawing on their courage and might. Workers, including craftsmen, women, and physicians, played vital roles in maintaining the society. The merchants, artisans, and jewelers were at the lower end of the social hierarchy, driving trade and commerce.  The people's social classes were determined by their contributions to the government. Those who worked for the Pharaoh held significant positions, while farmers and slaves were among the lowest. The social system was characterized by a hierarchical structure, where the elite controlled the means of production and distribution.",2.17293236566335,0.239216658363737
