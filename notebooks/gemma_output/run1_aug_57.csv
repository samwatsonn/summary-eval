Aristotle  believes that the goal of a tragedy is to ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and argues that in order for the tragedy to accomplish this goal, it should feature the downfall of a hero ""who is neiter eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought on not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" He thinks that if the hero were purely good, his downfall would simply be shocking to the audience, whereas the downfall of a purely evil man would not arouse pity or fear, since ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" and the audience would instead derive moral satisfaction from seeing the evil man get what he deserved. Finally, Aristotle writes that while a tragedy should ""be arranged not only the simple but on the complex plan"" but that there should not be a ""double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and bad"" because in that case the sense of pleasure from the audience will not be ""true tragic pleasure"" but closer to what the audience would feel when watching a comedy.","Aristotle believed that a tragedy should have a complex plot, but not a plot with two threads that have two different catastrophes for the good and the bad. Tragedy should cause fear and pity in the audience, and its plot should be arranged to evoke both pity and fear. A tragedy's goal is to impart the emotions of tragedy upon its audience. A tragedy should avoid having a simple plot with two contrasting events, allowing its audience to derive moral satisfaction from the contrasting fates of good and evil.",3.90032610436019,0.556479831902046
