Pity and fear can be drawn out of a viewer or reader when the characters do something to bring unfortunate circumstances upon themselves. For example, Romeo and Juliet create a situation in which they both end up killing themselves over the death of the other. In Greek tragedies, the characters must live with their mistakes and suffer, while in Shakespearian tragedies, the characters die. These two are similar because each person has misfortune brought upon them by their own misjudgment. This ties directly to how the character's situation turns from good to bad, rather than from bad to good. The plot must also be complex, well-constructed, and ""be single in its issue"".","Sure, here's the rewritten passage:  A tragedy should contain elements that evoke emotions, such as pity and fear, a well-structured plot that avoids redundancy, and a character's journey from a positive to a negative situation that drives the drama.
