66db2c282419,39c16e," Three elements of an ideal tragedy that are described by Aristotle are plot, character, and diction. Plot should give a single issue and not double and should be from good to bad in terms of change of fortune. The fortune should come as a result of error in a character from better to worse and imitate pity and fear. Character should be defiant of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity from the spirit of Tragedy and possess no tragic qualities and related to the audience to create emotions. Diction or choice of words should be arranged in a simple, but complex plan and imitate actions of pity and fear, while also thoroughly satisifing moral sense and well-being. Evidence to support these statements are in paragraphs 2 and 3 where it reads, "" A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves...A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse... the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty...A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" These pieces of evidence further support my assertion of the three main elements of an ideal tragedy being plot, character, and diction by showing the importance of a plot and its significance of portraying pity and fear and character and its importance of showing one's personality to be from adversity to prosperity, while showing the significance of diction and its well-being of providing a sense of pity and fear and satisying moral sense throughout the play and tragedy in its choice of words.","Sure. Here is a rewritten version of the passage, with a similar number of words and writing ability level:  An ideal tragedy must feature a single, developing plot that unfolds from good to bad in terms of change in fortunes. The character of a tragic hero should be defiant of a bad man, starting with adversity and rising to prosperity through a reverse transformation in fortunes. The tragedy should express emotions including pity and fear effectively, utilizing contrasting methods to elicit emotional responses from the audience. Lastly, the quality of diction and the selection of words must match the tone and theme of the play, injecting the play with a sense of pity and fear while also satisfying the moral sense, and the overall well-being and satisfaction of the audience. The evidence supporting these attributes, as mentioned in the passage, further strengthens the assertion that plot, character, and diction are the cornerstones of an ideal tragedy.",1.98471716382454,2.54906922938127
