In conclusion, Meat packing industrees had many ways to get customers to buy the rotten, or spoiled meat.","Sure, here is the reworded passage:  Meat packing industries used various techniques to conceal rotten or spoiled meat from consumers. One tactic was to rub soda on the meat to create a smellless, masking barrier. This method was employed by many meat packing plants, as they prioritized profit over ethical considerations. While food safety was not paramount for the industries, they relied heavily on deception to lure customers into purchasing contaminated products. Another strategy was the use of fancy skinning. This practice involved the use of old, heavy pigskin that was often discarded due to its dullness and lack of appeal. Despite their efforts to disguise the meat, consumers became aware of the practices employed by meat packing industries, leading to a decline in the purchase of rotten or spoiled meat.",1.97368894303533,1.41722731269078
