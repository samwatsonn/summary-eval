32f23f665431,39c16e,"According to this reading, Aristotle views the concept of an ideal tragedy by using elements of six different parts, but the most important according to him, are elements of plot, character, and thought. First, the element of the plot for an ideal strategy is meant to be the soul of the overall tragedy as a whole, and its main responsibility to keep every other factor that is part of a tragedy together. Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle's belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character's morals. ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.""(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. ""yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone's poor sense of judgement or by fate.

He starts out by describing actions, ""...excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Artistole, 2). The meathod that the author should take, Artistole suggests, is one where actions of the characters promote feelings of remorse and a little bit of fear for the excitement. Another element Artistole believes is in an ideal tragedy is, ""the downfall of the utter villian be exhibited"" (Artistole, 2). Connecting this to Hamlet, this means that if Claudius is the villian, he shouldn't die because it would cause the audience to think of it as misfourtune. Finally, the third ideal trait that a true tragedy should posess is, ""some great error or frailty, in a chracter"" (Artistole, 3). This ultimatly means that the main character, the protagonist, shall do something utterly stupid that worsens his own life. This truly would be depressing as the audience would want to see the protagonist grow in his life which goes from bad to good instead of good to bad.

First, he emphasizes the importance of emotional depth in tragedy by describing how actions of the characters can evoke a sense of pity and fear, thus highlighting the distinctly tragic nature of imitation. Secondly, Artistole advocates for depicting the downfall of the antagonist, focusing on the consequences of killing Claudius as a villian. Thirdly, he highlights the requirement of a tragic flaw or frailty in the main character.

3613c50796bc,39c16e,"Aristotle states that the most important element of an ideal tragedy is that it should excite pity and fear in the audience. He states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation""(7-9).  This element really helps to draw in the audience and make them feel the right emotions for the characters. Another element that Aristotle believes to be valid for a tragedy is that the main character should be a normal person, not terribly good nor evil. He describes this as, ""That of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity""(22-23). Having a more normal character makes it easier for the audience to relate to them as well as to feel for them and understand what they are going through. The last element that Aristotle describes is that of a well-constructed plot. He writes, ""The change of fortune should not be from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad""(27).  Structuring the plot in this way truly enforces the feeling and effects of a tragedy. These are just three small elements that the great philosopher, Aristotle, believed to be important in a perfect tragedy.","Aristotle emphasizes the importance of captivating the audience by evoking pity and fear in them with scenes that mirror real-life experiences. A tragic play should mirror real life in its portrayal of hardships and suffering, thereby effectively engaging the audience.
