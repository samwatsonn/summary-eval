This method involves intentionally dousing the meat in specific chemicals and repackaging it without a significant alteration in appearance. Consequently, the factory generates revenue by charging a higher price for the contaminated food, despite the potential health risks associated with consuming it.  Another tactic employed by the factory is the deliberate presentation of spoiled meat to the consumers through deceptive labeling practices. The factory manipulates the color of the meat to give it a more visually appealing appearance, masking the unpleasant odor and appearance. By doing so, the factory successfully avoids triggering negative responses or legal repercussions.  Additionally, the factory engages in questionable practices that further contribute to the spoiling process. They fail to adequately adhere to proper hand hygiene and sanitation practices, resulting in cross-contamination and the spread of bacteria. This negligence further compromises the quality of the food, potentially attracting health issues in consumers.  The factory's disregard for food safety and ethical practices allows them to profit from the sale of spoiled food products. It highlights a severe lack of oversight and accountability within the food industry, resulting in practices that prioritize profit over consumer welfare.",2.59486498203559,1.16303030921644

Primarily, Aristotle discusses about the importance of constructing a plot that goes from good to bad. Having a good to bad plot will lead to an ""end unhappily. It is... the right ending."" If this plot is able to work, the most tragic effect will be the outcome because it satifies ""the moral sense, [and' inspires pity or fear."" Moreover, an ideal tragedy needs to build emotions from readers. The perfect tragedy must ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" which is achieved by a change of fortune from good to bad. Aristotle makes it clear that emotions are able to occur when ""some great error or frailty"" happens that changes the character from descriptions mentioned before which makes a character go from good to bad. Lastly, a tragedy should be built on a complex plan. For a complex plan, the audience should feel pity for a character which would later be used against the audience. Trying to reverse the effects of making the audience feel pity to fear is key for a perfect tragedy as ""it is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators."" Poets need to take audiences by surprise because it's similar to killing off the main character of a movie, for it would bring in tons of emotion and catch the audience off guard of something they would never expect to happen. All in all, Aristotle tries to convey his point of how to create a perfect tragedy and demonstrates how thoughtful and impactful a tragedy could be.
