The first main element for a tragedy to be ideal is for it to follow a complex plan and/or plot. The twists and turns of the storyline should not be easily predicted by the readers. Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a relatable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion. An ""error of judgment or frailty,"" to be exact. This element is important because it creates further pity and fear for the readers to feel towards the character.
