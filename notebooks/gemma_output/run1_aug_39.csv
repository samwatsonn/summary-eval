This quote by Aristotle is comprehending the purpose of the passage to build up the ideal tragedy, and to make the experience for the audience more interesting and worth-while to bring about analogies and comparison on the greatness of tragedies, in general. Another element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is the use of pity and fear through imitation of certain actions from which  is a persuasive technique used to bring in the audience for more and feel compassion for the main character being affected at hand. Evidence from the text to support this statement is near the beginning of paragraph 2 where it states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.""
