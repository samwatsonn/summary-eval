That would lead to the audience feeling little pity or fear. The audience would not be able to properly sympathize with this character due to most being somewhere in the middle of those extremes. Additionally, both the plot and ending to a tradegy must show a steep downward spiral regarding this character's life preferably due to human error. That way ,the audience will feel both pity and fear knowing they could have acted similarly. Anything else will not evoke the proper emotions.
