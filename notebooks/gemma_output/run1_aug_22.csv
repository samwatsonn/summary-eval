For it was the custom, as they found, whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage.It was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta. Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions-a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference. There was never the least attention paid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white—it would be dosed with borax and glycerine, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption. ","Please rewrite the passage with a similar number of words and writing ability level.  Sure, here is the rewritten passage:  ""The factory's methods for dealing with spoiled meat were quite unusual. Whenever spoiled meat became unusable, it was either processed into sausage or chopped into smaller pieces and combined with other meat. There was no indication of any particular odor or smell ever being present in a processed ham, even if it had been spoiled. Any leftover meat that was processed for sausage was brought in from Europe, was either moldy and white or previously rejected due to its quality. It was combined with other meat and processed again for consumption, often with the addition of borax and glycerine to mask any bad smell.""",-0.382272237741744,-1.79549080344932
