The creation of pity and fear in the viewers is critical for a play because it is the ""distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" If it instead brings prosperity to adversity, the play doesn't invoke pity or fear and the result is just shock to the viewer, which is not the intention. A complex plot is also involved in an idealogical tragedy. Tragedies aim to be ""single in tissue, rather than double as maintain."" The plot should also not follow a storyline that goes from bad to good, but actually good to bad.  Lastly, character is another important aspect. Character is usually one that is considered to be a person who is good, but suffers misfortune and even their downfall due to their own judgement, making them very relatable. Usually they are also famous and prosperous, as seen with Oedipus and Thyestes. Therefore, pity and fear, complex plots, and character are all crucial to an idealogical tragedy.","Aristotle believed that a tragedy should consist of elements that evoke a sense of pity and fear and use a complex plot design.
