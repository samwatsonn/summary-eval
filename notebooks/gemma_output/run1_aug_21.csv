They used the chemistry in the method of rubbing the meat agains the soda to change the appearance and smell of the meat to make it more appetizing however, it hides the true condition of the meat.  Another way the factory covered up the spoiled meat was encorporating glycerin and borax from sausage rejected from Europe-suggesting the conditions of the spoiled meat were noticeable. According to paragraph 3 ""it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" Signyfying this was a repeated process to get the sausage accepted to other countries.

This process helped to conceal the bad condition of the meat.  Furthermore, the factory used a tactic of giving thirty-percent of the spoiled meat to acquire the appearance of ""Number One Grade.""
