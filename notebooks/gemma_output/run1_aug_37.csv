He explains that it must show how the main character goes through ups and downs and relate to the audience, how the main character should end with a  tragic downfall or suffer throughout the story, and how the story must focus around the tragedy and not have too many plots of other genres to try to obtain. In the text, Aristotle explains, ""inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves."" This shows one of the key elements to an ideal tragedy and explains how it must relate to a common human experience and scare the common audience because they related to the main character. Overall, Aristotle's three key elements to a tragic story are showing how the characters are like everyone else in humanity, having a tragic downfall, and how the story must be focused on the tragedy.","Aristotle offers insights into what constitutes a tragedy, highlighting that it should depict a character's journey through ups and downs, enabling the audience to connect with the protagonist through emotional experiences. A tragic ending and suffering should be central to the narrative, while other genre elements should be minimized to prioritize the tragedy. This perspective emphasizes the importance of creating a relatable human experience and instilling fear through the protagonist's fate.

82cb6b907881,ebad26,"    In the excerpt from the 1906 novel,""The Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair, it states the various ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat. In the text it states, "" Jonas told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed..."" (Sinclair par.2).  From the text it's shown that the workers would use baking soda to take away the strong odor of the sour meat, and even used chemistry to give it a more fresh taste and odor. This method saved the company money, but was wrong because it was selling people spoiled meat that could possibly make them sick. In paragraph 2 it also states, ""... some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle with destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty percent'"" (Sinclair par.2). When the stench from the meat was bad enought workers would also use a machine to fill the meat with pickle to help rid of the odors. They would use much stronger pickle, and still end up selling the spoiled meat. In the end, the ways they would cover up the spoiled meat is by using baking soda, pickle, or chemistry to help rid of the odors to sell spoiled meat to consumers. ","Sure, here is the rewording you requested:  In the novel ""The Jungle,"" by Upton Sinclair, it was revealed how the factory utilized various methods to handle spoiled meat. One tactic used was to rub spoiled meat with soda to alleviate the smell and enhance its taste. Another method involved the use of chemicals to refresh and rejuvenate the spoiled meat, which ultimately saved the company money. However, this approach was flawed, as it ultimately resulted in the sale of spoiled food that could potentially harm consumers.

This quote showed that the growth may not have started rapidly, but later the text says that the group eventually had 200 members. One of the ways this was possible was that outside of class, students used the salute, intriguing those not involved and eventually allowing more people to join. Most people give in to peer pressure, but when everyone around you is doing something, isn't it hard to not do that same thing as well? The experiment proved this simply with a fake group, and one person starting the wave with a few instructions grew to 200 people following those same instructions. The experiment had to be ended simply because it grew out of control.

First, the secrecy surrounding the group initially drew outsiders in, creating a push to join. Secondly, the constant pressure from those around them, despite its slow onset, compelled participants to join. With just three days, the group grew from 30 to 43 attendees, demonstrating steady expansion despite a gradual start.  One notable factor contributing to this surge was the use of a ritualized salute that attracted outsiders. This created interest among non-participants, gradually expanding the group due to peer pressure. This phenomenon highlights the significant impact of social influence, where individuals are motivated to join simply by seeing others participating.  The experiment's rapid expansion, despite initial limitations, underscores the vulnerability of organized groups to external pressures. A small spark, like the introduction of a new ritual, could trigger a domino effect and ultimately lead to a larger, uncontrollable group.",2.05508855772207,2.13270336016227
