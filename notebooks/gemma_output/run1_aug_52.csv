One man cannot be good nor bad but simply make a mistake. A good tragedy is when the man is just a normal person who takes the wrong turn or makes a deadly mistake that results in a series of alarming events.

This example greatly exemplified the magnitude of unsanitary items that were mixed in with the meat. Also, he employs strong diction to describe how the ""moldy and white"" sausage from Europe was used in conjunction with ""borax and glycerin"" to mask its odor, taste, and color. This again demonstrates the abysmal standards used in the meat-packing industry at the time, and further shows how the workers went to great lengths to sell the spoiled meat.","Through Sinclair's meticulous description, we learn how the factory took extraordinary measures to hide spoiled meat, seeking to maximize their profit by offering it for sale.

Sinclair employs powerful imagery to illustrate the grotesque process behind creating the sausage. The ""moldy and white"" European sausage was carefully crafted with a blend of substances that masked its odor, taste, and color.

b7d095ed2c75,39c16e,"One element of an ideal tragedy that is described by Aristotle is that a good tragedy should have one plot. I think this is because if there are multiple plots, there are more details and actions/events that happen. One plot really helps highlight the tragedy of one specific person or group.  A second element of an ideal tragedy is that the tragedy has to highlight the downfall of a character that readers can relate to. Relating to the character can help the readers feel more understandable of the incident that the character goes through, and because the character has to be relatable to the audience, the audience will see a little part of themselves in the character, which makes them feel pity. A third element of an ideal tragedy is that a tragedy should not resemble a comedy. A tragedy has to be serious, in order for the audience to feel fear, pity, and slight sympathy towards a character. Comedic feelings would cancel out the feelings of fear and pity which would harm the true meaning of a tragedy. ","Sure, here is the rewritten passage:  An ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, should have one central plot focused on one person or group experiencing a tragic downfall.
