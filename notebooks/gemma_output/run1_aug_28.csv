The third element of a good tragety is an unhappy ending. If the story ends happily for the protagonist then the story is not at all sad or tragic. We as people prefer to have a story end happily for the protagonist because it sits with us better. We prefer to walk away knowing that the main character got what they always wanted and that they found joy in the end. For the story to be truly tragic, the protagonist has to end the story on a sad note.

What this means is that a good and virtuous character (but not perfect) must suffer some kind of downfall. It can't be about a villian ""passing from adversity to prosperity,"" since that would not invoke the moral sense. Additionally, another requirement is that a tragedy must ""inspire pity and fear"". Pity is ""aroused by unmerited misfortune,"" while fear is aroused by that misfortune being experienced by a character relatable to the audience. Therefore, the character can not be perfect in virtue, but have some tragic personality flaws, as that would make him unrelatable. Finally, the change of fortune should always be from ""good to bad"", and the best tragic plots are ""single in issue.""","An ideal tragedy according to Aristotle must first satisfy the moral sense, which implies that a character, while possessing good characteristics, must suffer a form of misfortune.

This piece of evidence from the text tells readers that the factory would turn the spoiled meat into sausage because sausage didn't get much attention when it came to checking the meat for being spoiled or not.  This contributes to how the factory would cover up spoiled meat by telling the readers that the sausages were still sold out to the public, after being doused in chemicals and put into a hopper.  In conclusion, the factory would cover up their use of spoil meat by making it into a sausage so that there would be less criticism about the age of the meat and they were still able to sell it to the public.","The factory employed various tactics to conceal the use of spoiled meat. Paragraph 3 painted a picture of this manipulation, detailing the meticulous process of turning spoiled meat into sausage.
