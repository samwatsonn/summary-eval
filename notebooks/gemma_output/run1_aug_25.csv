Farmers, who were considered loyal slaves, paid taxes with their hard-earned food and sought refuge in the Pharaoh's protection in times of economic hardship. Soldiers, who were the backbone of the society, were responsible for maintaining order and protecting the city against invaders. Their welfare was the responsibility of the Pharaoh's people, and they were promised a fair share of food and resources, but this system was often skewed in favor of the soldiers. Slave morality was strict, with them having limited opportunities for advancement.

574369ff8f20,39c16e,"An ideal tragedy must have a relateable hero, a singular plot, and a plot where the hero's own human flaws cause their demise. This is exemplified by Aristotle's description of the ideal tragic hero. Paragraph 2 states, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" It's imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageously and comedically evil that succeeds because of their malevolence, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audiene will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphance when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they aren't bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. It's essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have relateable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Orestes and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.","Sure, here's the rewritten passage with a similar number of words and writing ability level:  The tragedy of a hero is one that appeals to an audience through its relatable hero, a singular, complex plot, and flaws in the hero's character that lead to their demise. The ideal tragic hero, according to Aristotle, should be a man admired and respected. He should be deserving of empathy and admiration, but he should also have flaws and weaknesses that contribute to his downfall. The audience should be able to connect with the hero on a personal level and understand the challenges they face.  In a Greek tragedy, the hero's qualities and flaws should be such that the audience can see themselves in them. The hero should be relatable and have a clear motivation for their actions. Their flaws should be significant and believable, but they should also be understandable. This allows the audience to connect with the hero on a deeper level and see the depth of their character.  The plot of a tragedy should be single and focus on the hero's journey. The plot should have a clear beginning, middle, and end, with a simple and consistent narrative that is easy for the audience to follow. The tragedy should be serious and emotionally resonant, and it should have a clear conflict between the hero and a nemesis.  The tragedy should also contain a complex protagonist who faces multiple challenges and setbacks. The protagonist should be relatable and suffer through both physical and emotional pain. The audience should be able to see the impact of the hero's actions on their life and the lives of those around them.

57d4aad66e97,39c16e,"    The ideal tragedy should include a multi-dimensional conflict, a neutral character's mistake, and that character's fortune turning from good to bad. A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict ""never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear"" due to its basic nature (""On Tragedy""). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they've made. This is because ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and empathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character's shoes (""On Tragedy""). The character's fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that's because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as ""great suffering, destruction, and distress,"" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary).

Therefore, writers should incorporate numerous traits that contribute to the multifaceted nature of a tragedy, as tragedies often fail due to the presence of a single tragic trait.  The main character should be neither good nor bad, as their misfortune stems from a mistake they have made.

583c75957289,814d6b,"The Third Wave was a social experiment designed to reveal the effects of mob mentality. A teacher named Ron Jones started the experiment by transforming one of his classes into a totalitarian environment. As time passed, exposure to the authoritarian class caused students from other classes to join in, wanting to fit in with their surroundings. After a few days, the movement expanded from the initial 30 students to over 200 students, and students had started to report when other members failed to follow the rules (showing their desire for superiority). In the end, Jones felt that he was losing control of the experiment since the students were becoming increasingly involved, so he revealed to the students that the entire Third Wave was just an experiment to show how people wrongly justify unmoral actions by connecting them to their pride and patriotism.","The passage presents a captivating scenario of a teacher experimenting with mob mentality and its consequences.

This helps tell us that if the kids didn't so a simple task correctly they would do it over and over until it was ingrained in their minds.  Mr.Jones had to stop the experiment because students stared taking it way to serious. In paragraph 3 it says ""Jones was surprised that some of the students started reporting to him when other members of the movement failed to abide by the rules.""
