A man who is not eminently good and just, yet their downfall is caused byerror of judgement or frailty. Some examples are Oedupis or Thyestes. This is because they are relatable to the viewers and pity or excitement can not be aroused  from simple adversity to prosperity or prosperity to adversity. Another key element is the plot. It should be a single plot where change of fortune should be from good to bad. Some of the greatest tragedies like the fortunes of Oedipus or Alcmaeon can back this up. Lastly, the ending is also a major facet of the ideal tragedy.

Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character shouldn't be too good, as this wouldn't invoke any pity, however, the character also shouldn't be too evil, or else the audience wouldn't feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune. Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behaviror. He says ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse."" Overall, Aristotle argues that a good tragedy should portray a character who is neither good nor bad, but rather somewhere in the middle, who experiences a change of fortune from good to bad due to some inherent flaw of his character. ","Sure, here is a rewritten version of the passage with a similar number of words and writing ability level:  One element of a tragic play, as outlined by Aristotle, is that there should be a significant shift in circumstances for the main character, from positive to negative. Aristotle emphasizes that a tragedy should showcase misfortune resulting from an error of judgment, rather than from moral deficiency. He suggests that the character should be in a state between virtue and villainy, experiencing a change of fortune that elevates his or her suffering to a tragic peak. Aristotle argues that the tragic narrative should depict a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in their character and not due to their character‚Äôs moral behavior. Overall, a tragedy should convey the experience of a character navigating misfortune due to an inherent issue.",3.50322573269907,3.63812632907257
