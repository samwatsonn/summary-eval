Aritsotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to befall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty..."" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good tradegy, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, ""...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villian dies a horrible death, the story won't have the necessary components.

As stated in paragraph 2, Aristotle remarks that "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" Aristotle is explaining how the best method of displaying tragedy in any poem is to put the main characters in a constant state of misfortune, which is meant to drive forward the narritive as it progresses. Next, Artistotle exclaims that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be relatable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil pasts. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, "" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible.""
