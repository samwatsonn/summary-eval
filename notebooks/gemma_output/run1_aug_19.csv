In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles.""  This qoute helps explain my answer because it states what work slaves had to do.  The farmers job was to tend fields, raise animals, kept canals, and more.  In the twelveth paragraph, the author mentions that ""Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay!""  This qoute helps explain my answer because it explains what the farmers do for a living.

The pharaoh, the most important and powerful leader, held spiritual and political authority. Nobles followed the pharaoh and possessed important administrative roles. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods through rituals and ceremonies. Craftsmen and women, in the middle class, produced and sold tools, utensils, and other objects for everyday use. Merchants and storekeepers played a crucial role in connecting with the public and facilitating trade and commerce.  The bottom class, including slaves and farmers, performed essential tasks that contributed to the survival of the society. Slavery was a harsh reality for many, as individuals were forcibly taken from their families and subjected to demanding labor and inhumane treatment.  The ancient Egyptian social structure demonstrates the importance of individual roles in a society, with each social class fulfilling vital roles that supported the smooth functioning of the state. The pyramid-like structure, with the pharaoh at the pinnacle, reflects the hierarchy and respect given to those who held high positions.",3.48081238123002,1.20696756722818
